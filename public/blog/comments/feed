		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for sharing!  I had no idea that a cheap &quot;copy&quot; screen could actually shorten the battery life on your phone, and cause batteries to overheat.  The hot battery could be disastrous, especially if the heat manages to cause hardware damage.  The last thing I would want to do is risk my $600 phone for a screen that was $25 cheaper!]]></description>
