		<description><![CDATA[At the end of the day, I think Apple out-softwares Samsung and that&#039;s a difference that they won&#039;t be able to touch. My experience with Galaxy phones has been a feeling of lagginess and that there are almost too many things that my phone wants me to control and change. The iPhone has never come close to other high-end Smartphones in terms of raw power, and yet from my personal experience feels snappier and far more responsive than them 9 times out of 10. What good is exponentially more powerful hardware if the software and the interface the user actually experiences doesn&#039;t keep up with the times?]]></description>
